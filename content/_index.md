As AI continues to evolve, it is becoming increasingly integrated into various aspects of software development. One area where this is particularly evident is in the work of fullstack developers. These developers are responsible for building and maintaining the entire software stack, from the front-end user interface to the back-end server infrastructure. However, many of the tasks that fullstack developers used to perform manually are now being automated by AI.

AI is capable of performing many of the tasks that were traditionally performed by fullstack developers, such as coding, testing, and deployment. This has led to a significant reduction in the amount of time and effort required to develop and maintain software applications. However, it has also raised questions about the future of fullstack development, and what role humans will play in this field going forward.
